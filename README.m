% a set of codes to estimate the benchmarks for a set of beyond CMOS
% devices
% To get comparisons of multiple circuits, type
% >> BCB
% After running 'BCB' routine, you have further options:
% To get a plot and to output files of throughtput and power, type
% >> throughPower
% To output files with areas of circuits, type
% >> areaNRI
% To get universal characteristics of devices (like charge and
% resistance)
% To get transistors' on- and off- current and volatges, type
% >> TransCurrent
